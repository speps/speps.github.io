My name is **RÃ©mi Gillig**, I am a video game Graphics programmer.

I like C++, C# and everything rendering related. Putting stuff on the screen and getting the best our of the talented art teams is so satisfying!

I like to follow the advances in this area through SIGGRAPH and GDC talks, lectures and research papers.

I'm currently working at Firesprite Ltd. (UK) as a Lead Software Engineer. Whatever projects appear on this blog are NOT affiliated with my current employer.
