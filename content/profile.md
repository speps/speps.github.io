My name is **RÃ©mi Gillig**, I am a video game tools software engineer.

I like C++, C# and making tools for everyone. It has a great impact on the projects and usually involves a number of other disciplines.

I am also interested in procedural generation and rendering and I like to follow the advances in these areas through SIGGRAPH and GDC talks, lectures and research papers.

I'm currently working at Rare Ltd. (UK) as a Senior Software Engineer. Whatever projects appear on this blog are NOT affiliated with my current employer.
